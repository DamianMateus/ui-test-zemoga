# Zemoga Front End Development - Candidate Test v2.1

Hey there! üëã I'm excited to share the Rule of Thumb‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Front End Development Challenge that I've completed. In this challenge, I worked on a responsive display component for our client's app, which tracks the sentiment of users on trending and controversial people from various fields. The goal was to create an interactive component that allows users to share their opinions through votes and displays the results in real-time.

## My Implementation

I tackled this challenge using React with TypeScript, leveraging the power of strong typing for a more robust development experience. The project structure revolves around the `App.tsx` entry point, where the interactive component is embedded within the `Banner` component. The `ListView` component takes care of rendering the list of cards and handling user interactions.

## Instructions to Run Locally

Here's how you can run the project on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository:

git clone [https://github.com/DamianMateus/ui-test-zemoga.git]

move into the folder

1.Install dependencies using Node.js version 18.3.0:

  npm install

2.Start the development server:

  npm start

3.Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to experience the app.


## Feel free to explore the code and functionalities, crafted with React, TypeScript, and pure CSS. Happy coding! üöÄ
